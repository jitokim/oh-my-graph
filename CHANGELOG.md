# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

oh-my-graph is **alpha software**. The graph YAML schema, the CLI, and the
`NodeRunner` interface may change without notice before `v1.0.0`.

## [v0.1.0] - Unreleased

Initial MVP: a graph-native orchestrator that runs each DAG node as a real
`claude -p` subprocess on the user's own Claude subscription.

### Added

- **YAML graph model.** A graph file (`name`, `inputs`, `concurrency`,
  `nodes`) with inline `depends_on` edges — no separate edge list, so the
  topology has one source of truth. DAG/cycle validation at load time.
- **Ready-set concurrent scheduler.** Kahn-style topological execution that
  keeps a "ready set" running concurrently, capped by `concurrency` (ceiling
  10, default 4). Halt-on-fail by default; `--continue-on-fail` prunes only
  the failed subtree instead of stopping the whole run.
- **`ClaudeCLIRunner` with subscription-auth env scrub.** The node runtime is
  a raw `claude -p ... --output-format json` subprocess. Every child process's
  environment has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` deleted so a
  node can never silently fall back to metered API billing — this is
  unit-tested against the built command. Never `--bare`, never the Agent SDK.
- **Artifact and session handoff.** `handoff: artifact` (default) persists
  each node's result to `.oh-my-graph/runs/<run-id>/<node-id>.out` and
  interpolates it into dependents via `{{ artifacts.<id> }}` (path by default,
  content with the `| inline` filter) — the only option for fan-in.
  `handoff: session` resumes a single parent's claude session
  (`--resume <session_id>`) for tight sequential continuation; rejected at
  load time on a node with more than one session-parent.
- **Success checks and retry.** `success_check` (`exit_zero`,
  `result_matches` regex) gates whether a node counts as passed. `retry`
  re-runs a failed node up to a flat `max`, always in a fresh session.
- **`RunLedger`.** End-of-run table (session id, cost, verdict, duration per
  node) plus the total cost across the run.
- **CLI:** `oh-my-graph run <graph.yaml> [--input k=v ...] [--concurrency N] [--continue-on-fail]`.
- **Auto mode.** `oh-my-graph auto "<goal>" [--input k=v ...]` plans a graph
  from a plain-language goal instead of hand-written YAML: a coordinator makes
  one planner call through the same env-scrubbed `NodeRunner` seam, loads the
  JSON reply with the existing graph parser and validator, saves the spec to
  `.oh-my-graph/runs/<run-id>/graph.json` (re-runnable with `oh-my-graph run`),
  and executes it on the same scheduler. A planned node can never request
  `permission_mode: bypassPermissions`.
- **Claude Code plugin surface.** A thin `plugin/` wrapper — a `/graph` slash
  command and a description-routed `run-graph` skill — that shells out to the
  `oh-my-graph` binary and reports back the run ledger. It reimplements no
  graph logic.
- **Shipped graphs.** `graphs/haiku-smoke.yaml` (the cheapest real end-to-end
  smoke, a few cents) and `graphs/dev-review-pr.yaml` (a worked
  dev → e2e → parallel review → PR example).

### Deferred (tracked, not in v0.1)

- `gate` node type / human-pause + `oh-my-graph resume` (schema-reserved,
  execution rejected with a clear "not yet implemented").
- Retry policies beyond a flat `max`; any graph DSL beyond `depends_on`.
- A TUI/dashboard — that's [fleetops](https://github.com/jitokim/fleetops)'s job.
- Mid-node budget kill (v0.1 records cost and halts only *subsequent* nodes).
- Worktree auto-creation for parallel edits.
